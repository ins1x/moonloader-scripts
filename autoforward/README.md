# AutoForward
Script for automatic movement by car (cruise control), and autoforward on foot.
Original script (https://www.blast.hk/threads/22082/)

### Changes:
fixed traffic when the auto cruise is turned off and the chat is open
fixed a bug with maintaining the speed limit when the cruise is disabled
fixed script crash when player teleporting, or leaving the vehicle for spectating
fixed broken limit on case script reloading or terminating

### How-to use
Use on foot:
Numpad / - enable automatic walking.
Numpad + - switch the walking mode to a faster one (Three modes in total).
Numpad - - switch the walking mode back.

Use in transport:
Numpad / - turn on the speed limit mode, if pressed a second time, the car will drive automatically at the set speed (the initial speed is taken from the current speed of movement).
Numpad + - increases the maximum speed at which the car can drive (It cannot be set higher than the standard one).
Numpad - - reduces the maximum speed of the car.
When you press the "S" and "Space" buttons in Auto Cruise mode, the car stops moving while you hold the buttons.
