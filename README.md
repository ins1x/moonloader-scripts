Various useful Moonloader [lua scripts](https://www.blast.hk/threads/22707/) for GTA [SA-MP](https://sampwiki.blast.hk/wiki/Main_Page) multiplayer.  
The presented systems were developed or improved by me, and implemented in working projects.  

[Moonloader](https://www.blast.hk/threads/13305/) is a mod for the GTA San Andreas game, aiming to become a complete modern replacement for [CLEO](https://cleo.li/ru/index.html).  
It introduces the ability to load Lua scripts into the game, has all the functionality of the game's opcodes, the [CLEO 4 library](https://cleo.li/ru/index.html), the [SAMPFUNCS 5+ plugin](https://www.blast.hk/threads/17/), [SAMP.Lua](https://github.com/THE-FYP/SAMP.Lua) and adds its own set of new features for development.
